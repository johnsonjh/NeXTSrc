/*
 * HISTORY:
 * 26-Mar-88  Daniel Julin (dpj) at Carnegie-Mellon University
 *	Converted to use the new memory management module.
 *
 * 10-Oct-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Added timer_wake_up extern declaration.
 *
 * 26-May-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Changed timer_start so that it assumes that the given timer is not on the timer queue.
 *	Added extern definition of timer_restart.
 *
 * 23-Apr-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Made TIMEVAL_CMP take struct timevals as arguments instead of pointers.
 *
 * 13-Apr-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Cleaned up once more!  Added TIMER_NULL.
 *
 * 16-Feb-87  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Cleaned up.
 *
 * 30-Jan-87  Thomas Newton (tdn) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Created minor variant of this file for use in Ada+ compiler;
 *		see HISTORY comments in timer.c
 *
 *  2-Dec-86  Robert Sansom (rds) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Make timer_queue and time_to_wake_up externs.
 *	Made all routine definitions extern (and included types where relevant).
 *
 * 10-Nov-86  Sanjay Agrawal (agrawal) at Carnegie Mellon University
 *	Started
